Installation
------------

If you have pip installed, you can install with:

    $ pip install pathtags

If you have setuptools installed, you can install with:

    $ easy_install pathtags

Otherwise, you'll have to download the package and run:

    python setup.py install

If you install it this way then you will also have to install all necessary
dependencies manually.
