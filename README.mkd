You will need to install PathUtils, ScriptUtils, and PIL:

    apt-get install python-imaging

    easy_install pathutils
    easy_install scriptutils

To install for yourself only (~/bin will need to be in your PATH):

    ./install

To install for everyone:

    sudo ./install /usr/bin

Once installed, to get help with basic usage and available options:

    pathtags -h
